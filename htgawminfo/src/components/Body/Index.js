            <h3>If you want to know more about the characters of ABC's hit tv show, then you have come to the right place.
                The website discusses on each character's alignment, traits, strengths, weakenesses, quotes, and so much more.
                From main characters such as Annalise and Wes to the minor characters like Meggy and Lila, you will get to know them a lot.
                As Annalise in the pilot and Christoph in the finale once quoted: "This is Criminal Law 100...or as it is preferred to be called:
                How to get away with murder."
            </h3>
